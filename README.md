The full lecture notes were made and are curated by dr. J.W. Portegies and may be found [here](https://gitlab.tue.nl/jim-portegies/analysis). This merely serves as a summary of the definitions, theorems, and propositions without proofs (mostly). 

Note that chapter numbers do **not** match between the original and this summary, and that this document may **not** contain all definitions, theorems, and propositions.

Examples and proofs can be found in the original lecture notes for 2MBA40 and 2MBA50.
